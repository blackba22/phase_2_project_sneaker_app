# Brittany's Sneaker Store

A shop that sells your favorite Nike sneakers.

## Description

It is a virtual sneaker store, where you can view and purchase certain Nike sneakers for a reasonable price.

## Getting Started

### How to Use App
* The app is very simple to use. On the Home page it lists which shoes are available. When you click the sneakers link, it will display a picture of the shoes along with the price and color of the shoes.

### Dependencies

* You will need to install React version 5
* For your backend server, you will need a service capable of running a Node.js server. [Render](https://render.com/) is a great example
* For your frontend server, you can use [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/#get-started)
* You will need to install React Router
